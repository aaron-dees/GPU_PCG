# GPU_PCG
This repository holds the code fro my Masters Dissertation project, it is a GPU implementation of a preconditioned conjugate gradient solver, using 2 preconditioners

The code presented in this repository will use a matrix free preconditioned conjugate gradient method to solve a three dimensional helmholtz equation. It will contain the serial code used and a GPU implementation using CUDA.
